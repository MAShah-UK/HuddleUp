# Huddle Up
**A communications application that will use LANs to quickly and efficiently share data with local users.** 

The following is a list of pros and cons compared to traditional messaging platforms, e.g. WhatsApp or Facebook:
* **Advantages:**
  * Does not require the Internet for communication.
  * Fast low-latency upload and download rates limited only by router bandwith.
  * Privacy is maintained as user data is not stored on a remote server for access by third parties.
  * Users in local area can quickly connect to each other.
* **Disadvantages:**
  * Must be within signal range of router.
  * Users wishing to communicate must be connected to the same router.
  * Will be difficult to confirm user identity via decentralised methods.
  * Cannot handle a large number of concurrent users.
  
## Discontinuation
While I believe in the project and can see it becoming successful, I cannot invest the time required to bring it to completion. I will attempt to do so in the future when conditions are ideal.
